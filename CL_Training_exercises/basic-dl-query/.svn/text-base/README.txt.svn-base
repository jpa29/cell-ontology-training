This illustrates basic DL (description logic) queries.

A DL query is a class expression that is constructed using constructs
such as "and" (corresponding to set intersection) and "some" (see
previous example).

Note that the example that follows this one also revisits DL queries.

Constructs used: "and", "some"

# open cc.owl
# Turn on hermit
# go to DL query tab
# find all subtypes of chromosome
# experiment with the tab - what do the different checkboxes give you?
# find all parts of a cytoplasm
## there are two ways to express this using the current GO - can you find both ways?
# find all chromosomes that are part of a cytoplasm
## do this *without* using GO_0000229

NEXT:

# find all classes whose instances have a snRNP as part
# find all classes whose instances have both a U11 snRNP AND a U12 snRNP as parts
# find all classes whose instances have both a U11 snRNP OR U12 snRNP as parts
# create a class from this DL query

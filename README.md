## Draft agenda:

1. Basic introduction to ontologies and ontology logic - why do we build ontologies and what we can do with them?
    - Why we build the logic and how we do that
2. Structure of the Cell Ontology
    - Decisions that have gone into why the structure is the way it is
    - Imported ontologies, such as Uberon, GO, PRO
3. Practical application:
    - How to use GitHub to request terms
    - Editing in Protege
    - Pull Requests
4. Use cases
    - Participant use cases - how do participants want to use the CL
    - High throughput data - what should be captured in a Cell Ontology term
    - When to add a term, when will it be accepted?

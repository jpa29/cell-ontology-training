    - Why we build the logic and how we do that
2. **History and Structure of the Cell Ontology** (Alex Diehl)
    - Decisions that have gone into why the structure is the way it is
    - Imported ontologies, such as Uberon, GO, PRO
    - Who has been using the CL
3. **Practical application** (Nicole Vasilevsky, Alex Diehl, David Osumi-Sutherland)
    - How to use [GitHub](https://github.com/obophenotype/cell-ontology/issues/) to request terms
    - Editing in [Protege](https://protege.stanford.edu/)
    - Pull Requests
4. **Use cases**
    - Participant use cases - how do participants want to use the CL?
    - High throughput data - what should be captured in a Cell Ontology term
    - When to add a term, when will it be accepted?
